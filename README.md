# DON'T BE INTIMIDATED BY SEM: Demystifying structural equation modeling and its practical applications to the Natural Sciences


Embark on this journey into the world of Structural Equation Models (SEM) – a cutting-edge statistical technique widely used by ecologists. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to SEM within the context of biodiversity-related sciences. Explore the complex relationships between variables and uncover how they interact and influence one another. No need to worry about algebraic complexities; we focus on real-life ecological applications that will enhance your understanding of natural systems. By the end of the course, you'll be equipped to (i) formulate hypotheses and conceptual models that unravel intricate ecological relationships, (ii) apply statistical techniques covered throughout the course, and (iii) confidently interpret and engage in insightful discussions regarding your results.  Prior familiarity with R (R program: http://www.r-project.org/) is highly recommended.
